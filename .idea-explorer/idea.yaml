  title: 'Conceptual Crossroads: Mapping Paradigm-Level Uncertainty in Language Models'
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Paradigm-level uncertainty in language models will manifest as distinct
    activation patterns compared to path-level uncertainty. Specifically, paradigm
    conflicts will produce more persistent, globally distributed activation signatures
    across multiple layers, while path uncertainty will be more localized and transient.

    '
  background:
    description: 'This idea explores whether token-level uncertainty sometimes stems
      from competing conceptual frameworks rather than just alternate reasoning paths.
      We''ll test this by creating prompts with embedded paradigm conflicts and measuring
      how hidden state dynamics differ between path-level and paradigm-level uncertainty.
